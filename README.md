Often girls in rural areas are having issues regarding sanitary pads. Arranging pads for them in the large amount is itself a heavy task for normal parents. We prepared a website (as of now static) for NGOs to raise fund and buy the sanitary pads for rural girls in huge amount. Also, we connect sanitary pads manufacturing companies with NGOs or other organizations to buy pads in bulk in less amount, so that girls could be easily provided with pads. This would increase the awareness among girls in rural areas as still most of them are not familiar with sanitary napkins or menstrual cups. It would be a great initiative to help them grow and maintain hygiene in affordable amount.
